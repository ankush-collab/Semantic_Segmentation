# üöó DeepLabV3+ for Semantic Segmentation on Cityscapes (30-Class)

This project implements **DeepLabV3+**, a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model, on a custom dataset based on the **30-class version of the Cityscapes dataset**. The goal is to train the model to accurately segment urban scenes into various classes such as roads, buildings, traffic signs, vegetation, and more.

## üß© Problem Statement

Accurate scene understanding is a critical component of applications such as **autonomous driving**, **urban planning**, and **robot navigation**. This project aims to solve the problem of **pixel-level classification** of high-resolution urban images using a **deep learning-based semantic segmentation** approach. Traditional segmentation methods struggle with the spatial complexity of real-world urban environments, especially where multiple classes overlap or are visually similar. The challenge lies in achieving high pixel-wise accuracy across a large number of visually diverse classes.

## üí° Proposed Solution

We implemented a **DeepLabV3+** model with a **ResNet-101** backbone. This architecture is particularly effective for segmentation tasks due to:

- **Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP):** Captures multi-scale contextual information by applying dilated convolutions at different rates.
- **Encoder-Decoder structure:** The encoder extracts rich contextual features while the decoder refines the segmentation output, recovering sharp object boundaries.
- **Transfer Learning:** Leveraged pretrained DeepLabV3+ weights from ImageNet and fine-tuned on the 30-class Cityscapes dataset.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated model performance using standard semantic segmentation metrics:

- **Pixel Accuracy (PA)**
- **Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)**
- **Class-wise Accuracy**
- **Visual Inspection of Predictions**
