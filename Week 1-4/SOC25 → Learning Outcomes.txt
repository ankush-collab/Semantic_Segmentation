Week 1 - 4 → Learning Outcomes


Week 1 → Deep Learning Fundamentals -1


In the first week, the topics covered were foundational and primarily served as a review of concepts I was already familiar with. These include basic principles of Neural Networks -> what deep learning is, how neural networks function, and the basics of training via forward and backward propagation. Explore activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) and get hands-on with PyTorch or TensorFlow basics.


Week 2 → Deep Learning Fundamentals -2


In Week 2, the focus shifted toward understanding and implementing Convolutional Neural Networks. I implemented a basic CNN using PyTorch and trained it on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This hands-on exercise reinforced my understanding of how CNNs learn low- to high-level features across layers. It also gave me practical experience with defining architectures, managing overfitting through dropout and batch normalization, and evaluating performance.


Week 3 → Semantic Segmentation Basics


In Week 3, some concepts were entirely new to me and required additional time and focused effort to grasp. 
I began by watching beginner-friendly videos to build a strong foundational understanding. Through this, I explored how semantic segmentation works and how it differs from other vision tasks. I also learned about key evaluation metrics such as mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and pixel accuracy, which are crucial for assessing segmentation model performance.
It also includes popular architectures used for segmentation, including Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) and U-Net. I put special emphasis on understanding and implementing U-Net, due to its relatively simpler and more intuitive structure compared to advanced architectures like DeepLabv3+ with ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling). Overall, this week was both challenging and rewarding. 
Week 4: DeepLabV3+ Architecture


In Week 4, the focus was on exploring the DeepLabV3+ architecture. This week built upon the foundational concepts covered in Week 3, and significantly deepened my understanding of high-resolution pixel-wise prediction through advanced architectural components.
The primary learning goal was to study the encoder–decoder structure of DeepLabV3+.
To reinforce the theoretical understanding, I followed a hands-on tutorial and tried implementing a simplified version of DeepLabV3+ using Google Colab. This included loading pretrained DeepLab models via PyTorch, preprocessing datasets, running inference, and visualizing segmentation maps. While implementation was more complex than U-Net, the guided tutorial and structured experimentation helped me navigate the architecture successfully.
